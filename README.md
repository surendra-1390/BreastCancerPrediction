# BreastCancerPrediction_Project
Breast cancer Prediction - A classification Based machine learning Project (March 2022 – May 2022)

## Objectives of this project
1. It was a classification type model. We have used a very popular data set Wisconsin dataset.
2. In this project our aim is to predict the given input tumor was Malignant or Benign.
3. Our model was well trained and we got the highest accuracy of 96%.
4. We have used SVM, Random Forest, K-NN, Decision tree Naïve Bayes Classifiers in this model.
